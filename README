% jectl

See overview-jectl.txt for tool usage. This needs to be converted
into a manual page.

overview-zfs-layout.txt gives a brief explanation of how jectl
manipulates zfs datasets.

overview-generate-je.txt explains how to create jail environments
using poudriere-image(8) and generate-je.sh. The created jail
environments are meant to be consumed by jectl.
